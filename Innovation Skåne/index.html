                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <p>The emotional experience of placing a relative at retirement home can be very difficult. For a child, it might mean the lifting of a burden and allow them to spend more time on their other family members, career, etc. They have spent much time being caretakers but now they can be sons and daughters again and spend more time on their relationships with their parents instead of being concerned about practical issues. For a spouse, it might be experienced as an involuntary divorce since they will not live with their partner. The relative leaves their care role to the care staff. This transition might prove difficult as the relatives have become experts in caring for the resident, they must learn to trust that the staff will do a good job.
                    <br><br>
                    This design project is putting the relative of the care recipient at the center of research and the purpose is to explore their viewpoints and experiences of elderly care. We want to take a look at how we might improve the experiences of the relatives and the relationship they have towards the sheltered housing.

                    <h2>Our Approach</h2>
                    <p>We began with field research, where we conducted interviews with the staff that was available during the afternoon shift. The results of our visits were very positive as we were able to observe the environment and get first-hand information from the staff and their perspectives on how the facilities operate. We interviewed the operations manager, the head nurse and a social worker, employed by the municipality with the role of giving support to relatives. This interview helped us get an overview of the relative's needs. We also conducted two workshops with caregivers at the retirement home.
                        <br><br>
                        Based on our findings, we made a stakeholder map of the current retirement home in Perstorp. We sought to cover specific pain points and interactions with care-staff and social workers which made the relatives feel at ease or worried. To get an overview of this we made a user journey map of the process of moving to a retirement home and the feelings involved for the relatives.

                            - Feeling involved <br><br>
                            Relatives tend to feel guilty and contact nursing staff as a way of expressing concern → Improve the everyday communication between relatives and residents through some mechanism that enables them to share moments from their lives.<br><br>
                            Relatives don’t trust the staff as much as they trust themselves → Improve communication between staff and relatives for getting better impressions of their care.
                            <br><br>
                            Relatives need more information about the process of moving in → Provide relevant information within existing or new touchpoints.

                            <p>As an interaction designer, both me and the team were presented with numerous challenges taking on the role of service designers through this design case. As the process expanded, our design case became progressively more complex as touchpoints were often ’touched’ by more than just the residents, there was an underlying need for addressing all stakeholders during the ideation phase to comprehend the impact of all touchpoints within our user journey.
                                <br><br>
                                I was in charge of communicating with the retirement home, planning and coordinating workshops and interviews. My role in the team and competence was most noticeably in collection of data, interviewing care-staff, the head nurse, residents and relatives and pinpointing the most relevant and important details from these interviews that helped us understand the underlying needs of all stakeholders.

                      <h2>Outcome</h2>
                      <p>After analysing the services provided in Perstorp’s retirement homes, we have identified the pain points and issues and as a result of our research, we have put forward a few suggestions/proposals for how to create more trust and improve the relationship between relatives and staff. 
                          <br><br>
                          The solutions are simple, easy to implement, and do not require much time or extra tasks from the staff. More importantly, they address some of the issues encountered by relatives when interacting with the services of the retirement homes in Perstorp. The first proposal is the redesigned welcome letter and the second proposal is something we call 5-min talk.
                        </p>

                <h2>Welcome Letter</h2>
                <p>As much as phone calls and other long-distance means of communication might help relatives to stay in touch with their elderly relatives and their caregivers, nothing can replace in-person communication. This is especially the case when it comes to building a trusting relationship with a new person. When visited by relatives, some of the caregivers reported going out of their way to try to have a small informal chat with the relatives. They described these moments as decisive for building and maintaining a good relationship with the residents’ families. Both staff and relatives mentioned the importance of face-to-face interaction as the best way to get to know one another.
                    <br><br>
                     The welcome letter is a physical letter the new resident and relatives will receive when it is time to move in. The letter contains information about practical errands and a brief introduction to the staff members that will take care of the new resident. We chose to put practical information in the letter since there’s a great need for more information when the approval for moving in has been determined. Many times this is plain information that can be put on the website but might be hard to find. Including this information will greatly help the information flow between the new resident and retirement home and in so help reduce the  workload and responsibility the social worker has. The pictures and introductions of the staff members is a way for the new resident and their relatives to get to know the staff and feel more comfortable during the transition process. The staff’s contact information will also be provided for easier access to them directly.

                            Despite the benefits of these short interactions between relatives and staff, they only occur on the caregivers own initiative. For this reason, we suggest integrating this short conversation into the visitation process so that it does not depend on the initiative of any individual caregiver and becomes a fixed part of the services offered to the relatives.
                            <br><br>

                            This addition would not require any additional knowledge, takes only a few minutes and has the potential to increase the relatives’ engagement in the care process as well as strengthen their relationship with the caregivers.
                            <br><br>
                            We imagine this touchpoint as a simple and informal conversation with the relatives right after their visit with their loved one. The goal of this interaction is to assess the relatives needs and concerns, and address them in a supportive manner.

                            What not to do:<br><br>
    
                            1. Evaluate: do not immediately let the other person know whether you agree or disagree.
                        </p> </div>

                            <p>
    2. Probe: do not keep asking questions and investigate. This will lead to them feeling attacked and that their opinion doesn't matter.<br><br>
    3. Advise: do not counsel purely based on your personal experiences.<br><br>
    4. Interpret: do not try to define the motives of the behavior based on your personal experience.<br><br>
    If you are giving out advice to a relative whether it is something they ask you to do or help them deal with emotions it should not be to try to define the motives of those feelings purely based on your own experience but rather fully try to understand why they are feeling that and try to respond.
    <br><br>
    To help the relatives know that the staff cares about the relatives involvement and opinion. This is what they should think about when having a conversation.
    <br><br>
    What to do: <br><br>
    
    1. Mimic the content: repeat what the relative just said. This ensures that you are listening and that the other person knows you’re listening.<br><br>
    2. Rephrase the content: tell the same story, but in your words. You show not only that you are listening, but that you understood what the other person is saying.<br><br>
    3. Reflect on feelings: focus on the emotion that lie behind what is told, not on the words that try to express these emotions.<br><br>
    We understand that each relationship with a relative is unique and has its own peculiarities. Therefore, these guidelines are meant to be seen more as a set of best practices than strict instructions. We believe that incorporating a short conversation based on these guidelines during a visit will help establish more trust between relatives and staff, and support the development of their relationship. This is even more important when the medical condition of a resident starts deteriorating, such as if the caregivers need to talk to the family members about very delicate subjects such as moving the resident to a hospital.

                  <h2>A Different Angle and a New Concept</h2>
                  <p>As a team we turned our attention to building a closer relationship between care-staff and the relatives. We thought that establishing trust both early and continuously would help the relatives feeling less worried. The suggested solutions are a good starting point and can lead to a better overall emotional experience for the relatives. However, these solutions are reformulated versions of what the municipality are already trying to achieve, the caretakers are often overwhelmed  and find less quality time to spend with the residents of the retirement home, something they call Guldstunder. This means that even if our solutions are improved versions of their system the care-staff are still short on time as it stands right now. The welcome letter is still something that can help with the first impression of the retirement home but the 5-min talk improvements might not be possible to implement as it is already something the care-staff are not able to execute as often as they would like.

              <h2>Develop</h2>
              <p>After initial research and brainstorming, we used several ideation methods for developing our ideas. We used concept portraits and the X-3-5 method (Gkouskos, 2017). The concept portraits didn’t provide us with any direct ideas but instead helped to show us emotions and experiences, that we wanted our design to reflect onto the people using it.
                  <br><br>
                  The X-3-5 method helped us really moving forward when we were stuck on an idea. Even when we had ideas this method helped us in developing these in creative and innovative ways.
                <br><br>
                Lastly we used time flow diagrams (Gkouskos, 2017) to help us organize all our different ideation methods since we found that this was a good way to visualize our development and understand the big picture.
              </p>
              <p>Throughout the ideation we discussed how we could make throwing rubbish fun. We discussed many different ideas that changed the physical appearance of the garbage bins as well as adding things like QR codes to add more interactivity. We realized that we wanted to stay away from altering the physical aspects of the rubbish bins, so that everyone can still use them without having to do anything extra to engage with the garbage bins if they don’t want to. We wanted the design to be able to be used by everyone, but it should not be mandatory. The ideation moved us in the direction of making an app because it addressed these issues.</p>

                <h2>Deliver</h2>
                  <p>After ideation we settled on an app idea that involves motion and shape recognition features. The app is a game where you collect and upgrade your monsters, that you collect from different garbage bins. You simply walk up to a garbage bin and with the app scan the garbage bin and the trash you want to throw away. You throw the trash in and a monster will appear. If you keep putting trash in, the monster will continue growing.
                    <br><br>
                    The first prototype we developed was made of cardboard and paper to closely resemble the feel of a real phone and using it to point and scan. There were several pages that you flipped through to show you the different stages of the process, when using the app. In our user- testing this turned out to be explained and showed with too much technical detail. There were too many steps and it was not clear when you had to flip the page. Understanding what actually happened and how the app functioned made sense. Part of the problem was that it was a flip mechanic and not touch or tap. We also understood by doing a physical prototype that it was important to make the physical interaction on the screen as minimal as possible since you're holding rubbish in your other hand. When developing our second prototype we considered this information and decided to design the prototype using software called Marvel to build our prototype app in. Marvel (2017) is a software where you can get a visual representation of the app and it gives you touch and transition options to illustrate what the final product could do and what it would look like. Marvel made it possible to get a more accurate representation of the app, but the physical prototype was still essential to understanding which areas of the prototype needed the most work.

        <h2>What went well</h2>
          <p>- Good group dynamic. We were able to hear each other out and express our thoughts and ideas really well within the group. We feel like everyone made their voices heard throughout the process and we listened to every idea, thought and considered them before making a decision that would impact the group. Also an very important aspect of our good group dynamic is that everyone did an equal amount of work so there were no disputes of skewed workload.
              <br><br>
              - Narrowing the area down and focusing our research on relevant areas. We had a quite big focus area to work with. We were given parks and squares to focus on and we were pretty quick to pick a specific problem area and a specific use group.
              <br><br>
              - Ideation went really well, we used a lot of methods in our ideation, but the concept portraits and x-3-5 were most important. The concept portrait was great for showing us what emotions and experiences we wanted to convey through our design. And x-3-5 was great for helping us to come up with the idea itself, what it was that we were going to create.

        <h2>What could have gone better</h2>
          <p>- Criticizing more, not just negative critique but just more critique overall. It felt like we were all agreeing to much, this was in part due to our great group dynamic, but we should be more open with our criticizing. Good ideas can come from criticizing and point out weak points in an idea. It is also important to know potential flaws with a design. As long as you don't get too negative or too nitpicky critiquing shouldn't be an issue and this might be an area where we could improve.
              <br><br>
              - Could do even more in the ideation stage, use more methods and try more new things. We used different methods in our ideation stage, but it felt like we could do more, or try some new ideation methods. Although we felt like our ideation stage wasn't a problem, we still felt like this was an area where we could improve greatly.
              <br><br>
              - Could analyze our fieldwork more and more efficiently. We gathered heaps of data with our research and our analysis of this data was not the most efficient. We had such a big area to focus on at first it meant doing a lot of research that was never used in the end. At the time when we decided on an area and target group we gathered some more data but it became too much for us to analyze in the time span that we had so we had to prioritize and focus our analysis on the most important parts. Moving forward we decided that it would be best to set aside more time for research analysis, since we learned that this was a very important step that we didn't put the necessary amount of time into.
