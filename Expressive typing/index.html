        <p>People are individuals. This statement might seem self-evident and excessive, but in the field of digital writing, it raises interesting concerns. Can you truly express yourself with a keyboard? Does your personality shine through from a collection of ones and zeros? In analog, paper-and-pencil, writing an abundance of minute details shine through. Immediate emotions, the physical strength of the hand holding the pencil, engrained patterns of writing that develop during the early stages of your life. What if we could also transfer these properties, these traits, onto digital writing?
            This is what I endeavored to explore with my thesis.
            </p>
                <!--<h2>A thesis project</h2> -->
                  <p>The idea of expressive typing is about making digital typing more expressive similar to the capabilities of handwriting. In handwriting, we can observe the text and say that it was written in various ways such as beautifully, carefully, or with haste. Handwriting also possesses the ability to tell us about the patterns and habits of people who wrote the text which makes it possible to identify handwritten texts. We are all able to recognize our friend’s or families’ handwritten texts just by looking at their handwriting style. These expressive capabilities were the inspiration and long term goals for this thesis project.</p>
                  <p>During the exploration phase, two distinct ways of experiencing typing were discovered. These two categories were namned Expressive styles and Typing immersion. Expressive style focuses on expressing something from you into the digital realm while Typing immersion focuses on the system giving the writer an impression while typing, that quite dramatically changes the way we experience typing. More extensive and detailed information about how these categories were discovered and how they sometimes overlap will be explained later on. For now, I will continue with showcasing the two categories.</p>

                  <p>Expressive styles prototypes were about specifying the expression in order to convey clearer and more meaningful expressions of the writer and for the reader of the text. The three expressive qualities were chosen from handwritten text observations. The expressive qualities were beauty; which was an experiment aimed to enable a wider range of writing styles and appearances on digital devices. Care; which was an experiment meant to explore how and if it's possible to express a sense of care through skill and slower more precise actions. And lastly haste was about giving the writer and reader a sense of quickness with which the text has been written.

                      If you want to know more about these prototypes; How I digitalised handwriting characteristics and transfered some of these qualities to the prototypes. How I enabled users to see and reflect over their own writing behavior as well as how we can use these qualites to inform the receiving end of a message, about the person's writing situation.

                  <p>Typing immersion prototypes were about how the output is affecting or immersing you to feel a particular sensation when typing. When the user is typing in a particular way the system detects it and behaves in a way that gives the user a certain impression. The three prototypes used different animations to try to immerse or affect the user in a particular way. The three animations chosen were fading in, bouncing and falling letters. The fading in of letters was an experiment aimed to make the user feel a sense of relaxation and calmness. Bouncing letters tried to give an impression of playfulness or enjoyment while typing. The last experiment aimed to immerse the user into a sense of unease and being uncomfortable.

                                Sketching is often used to generate ideas or run a simple test of an idea, while prototyping usually means testing a more concrete solution, idea of concept. In the case of this project the two terms and practises became blurred. Meaning some of the sketches and prototypes contained a mix of both when generating knowledge. (This is also the reason for why I call the sketches and prototypes some time for experiments instead of trying to define them.) </td>

I was interested in what qualities typing could possess and how we can utilise a digital environment. How would we experience and interpret these qualities? And how interaction designers could use these tools to design richer and more expressive typing?
                                              <br><br>
                                                I also applied the double diamond thinking then I started to explore ideas for experiments and sketches. To develop ideas during this stage, I planned the coming weeks like a design sprint. The sprint lasted two weeks and consisted of: </p>
                                                
                                                <h3>1. Understand</h3>
                                                <p>I mapped out the problem and pick an important area to focus on: As I said earlier I researched how handwriting achieves such a high level of expression. I discovered that there are two fundamental components that enables this level of expression, variation in letters and a sense of control. Both of these leads to expressing patterns and habits of a person’s writing. However, it is not wise to assume that the same level of variation and control can be achieved in a digital environment. To understand how typing in a digital space could have similar expressive qualities as handwriting, I needed to investigate how to work with the limited factors of keyboard inputs as well as the limited qualities of digital text. 
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    <span class="textWeight">The limitations of keyboards</span><br>
                                                    Within any interactive system, there is an action and a response from the system. The response, also referred to as feedback, is the system informing the user that their action was registered. However, there is a difference between the system acknowledging your action and reflecting on how you performed the action.  
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    One of the main challenges in enabling user expression when typing appears to be how we currently measure user input. For instance, a keyboard’s ability to measure the users’ input is far less extensive and sensitive than handwriting as it involves complex motor skills and movements of the hand. The keyboard measures each individual key press and present identical letters that do not give any sense of individuality or expression. To tackle this issue I decided to measure speed and pressure inputs from the user and use this data to manipulate the text being written. This enables the system to reflect how you performed an action and allow dynamic state changing while performing an action.

                                                        Digital text can’t alter each line of a letter as handwriting can. Handwriting’s ability to alter letters line by line leads to natural variation as mentioned by Huber and Headrick (1995). This variation of letters that is present in handwriting leads to the behavioural expressive qualities of the person who is writing, in a sense the personal expression of the user. In a digital environment, text manipulation is much more limited and includes the ability to change a parameter such as size, scale, boldness, and tilting but digital text cannot alter letters line by line.
                                                        <br><br> add picture here!!
                                                        <br><br>
                                                        Dynamically changing fonts such as kinetic texts and dynamic fonts is a way of manipulating digital text. Variable fonts, a dynamically changing font, have proven to be useful in the context of expression, as it can manipulate the appearance of each letter. A variable font is not as unlimited in its ability to vary the appearance of letters when compared to handwriting but can change parameters of a letter’s appearance, such as width, weight, and size dynamically. Variable fonts add expressiveness by the fact that they can alter each letter based on inputs from the users, such as speed or pressure. Manipulating width, weight, and size properties of letters dynamically, in combination with a users’ input, does provide the tools necessary to add variation to each letter by letter.

                                                        <h3>2. Ideate</h3>
                                                <p>I sketched out ways for typing to be expressive on paper and through simple code. I categorised different tools that are available on computers and connected them with speed and pressure inputs. I used different variable fonts and animations  in multiple variations. This resulted in many interesting ways of experiencing one’s own typing. I tried to add enough variation to the letters using variable fonts without distorting and increasing illegibility too much but still draw inspiration from how handwritten texts are composed. I also tried different animations to see if I could enhance the feeling of the letters being created in the moment rather than letters instantaneously appearing. As this is a key characteristic of handwriting. </p>
                                                
                                                <h3>3 & 4. Decide and Prototype</h3>
                                                <p>I made decisions on which qualities were most interesting and expressive and turn them into testable prototypes. These prototypes were not put into specific context but rather stayed open so I could critique the qualities a lot more carefully and proper without distractions or influences. In total there were 6 prototypes.</p>
                                                
                                                <h3>5. Test</h3>
                                                <p>I then tested these prototypes on myself since they required a close first-person perspective as it gives direct access to attention to detail and deeper articulation and understanding of the experience in relation to exploring expressive typing. At this early stage it would have been very difficult for participants to understand what was being tested and what it was they were experiencing.

                      <p>This prototype is using a variable font that is manipulating weight, width and size of a letter depending on the speed of your writing. Writing a letter slow results in bolder text and writing faster results in thinner text. Why this particular prototype is interesting is because it enables the writer of the text to recognise their own hesitation or thinking involved when writing the text. This furhtermore leads to the prototype enabling us to think more about our personal writing habits.

                <p>As you can see the prototype responds to the speed of your writing. You might also notice that the letters fade in with slightly different delay depending on the speed of your writing. This effect creates a calming effect when typing, which gives you an impression rather than you being expressive. We will talk more about this difference shortly.

                  <h3>Insights from the sketches</h3>
                  <p><span class="textWeight">There's a lack of clear expressions:</span> Many of these experiments had expressive qualities both from an explicit and implicit point of view. Explicit meaning that it was possible to write in a specific way and make a visual expression while doing it. Implicit meaning, the text showed visual clues of your writing behaviour. However, the expressions were not clear or expressive enough for the writer of the text nor the reader of the text to. As a writer, I cannot express myself through the bolding of letters in a meaningful and attractive way. As a reader, I cannot make sense of bolding of letters as to the same degree as what the writer wanted to express to me. Clearer expressions and a clearer objective for myself was needed. 
                </p>
                  <p><span class="textWeight">Expressive and impressionable experiences:</span> The second thing I learned was that some of the experiments and sketches changed the experience of typing into an impressionable experience compared to an expressive one.
                    <br><br>
                    On the one hand I had the experience of being expressive towards the system and it responding and on the other the system responding too your actions that resulted in the system being expressive towards you.  
                </p>
                  <p><span class="textWeight">The difficulty of manipulating digital text continues:</span> 
                    There’s a poorness to variable font as a material in relation to accomplishing meaningful and clear expressions. I need to take a step back and rethink some of the things I learned from researching handwriting and digital text visualisation. I need to be bolder in how I represent the visual feedback of letters. In a way that it is not copying handwriting characteristics but translating the characteristics and transforming them into digital visualisation. 
                </p>
                <h3>New prototypes</h3>
                <p>The next design sprint was similar to the previous one but focused on the knowledge learned from the previous one and was divided into two categories, expressional and impressionable experiments.</p>
                <h3>Expressive styles experiments</h3>
                <p>This category is about experimenting with more specific types of expressive qualities in typing and hopefully lead to clearer and more meaningful expressions of the writer and for the reader. 
                    <br><br>I started investigating how to enable a larger expressivity by collecting and analyzing my own and other people’s handwriting. The letters and overall appearance could either be perceived as beautiful, normal, distinct, written quickly or with haste as well as written with care or effort. Based on these findings beauty, haste and care seemed most distinctive based on the gathered observations.
                    <br><br>
                    The next section will include an explanation on how I designed beauty, haste, and care experiments. In all three experiments I needed to decide what the output would look like and how you would have to write to produce the letters' visual appearance. This time around I had a clearer vision since I could try to mimic the handwritten equivalent but adapt and redesign it to a digital environment. The expression also had a clear meaning of what it wanted to say.
                </p>
                <h3>Beauty</h3>
                <p><span class="textWeight">The aim of the writing appearances</span><br> This prototype is not meant to determine what is defined as beautiful but rather explore the possibility of expressing a range of writing styles and appearances. Beauty is an experiment meant to enable a wider range of writing styles and appearances. Beauty is subjective, however, determining a writing appearance that is more preferred than the other is the aim. One being "beautiful" and the other being "bad" writing.

        <p><span class="textWeight">Determining the writing pattern required to produce the two extremes</span><br> After having determined the aim for how the letters and overall text should look like after you have written it. Now it was time to determine how you would have to write to produce the range of writing styles. 
         <br><br>Our writing speed on computer are usually very high but also very inconsistent since we usually only think about what words we are writing and not how fast or slow we are writing the letters. Previous speed tracking experiment showcased exactly that, how letters were both varied (inconsistent) and not varied (consistent) at times. I therefore decided that writing with a consistent writing speed will result in a consistent and symmetrical appearance of letters, which is associated with a beautiful writing style. While writing with an inconsistent writing speed will result in inconsistent and asymmetrical letters. Meaning the way you write, will be reflected on the screen. You will have to think about how you are writing each letter. 
        </p>
      <p><span class="textWeight">How I designed the letters</span><br> The aim was to make letters look consistent and symmetrical or inconsistent and asymmetrical depending on the writing behaviour. The problem now was that digital text is inherently designed to be consistent and symmetrical. There are few commonly used typefaces that are less symmetrical and less legible.

              <p>We started with an ideation phase and tried to brainstorm how the player would learn each part of a letter using a drop of ink, since this was the original idea for the project. <br><br> 
 
                We sketched scenes with different interactions between the user and the game before starting 
                to work on the first digital prototype. The first idea was for the user to move their arms, 
                which was connected to the movement of the canvas.  
                The ink would fall from the top of the screen and the player would have to move their arms 
                to make sure the ink drop would land on the letter. 
                <mark>In this sketch we also talked about implementing a feature where 
                the player could use their hands to turn a letter, upside down or side ways to fill different parts of a letter. 
                This seemed too stressful, considering the time of a falling ink drop. And not very intuitive to control considering the other movement of the game.
                So we scraped this idea.</mark></p>

                To try to see how this interaction would feel like. After testing this myself,

                made the interaction more fun and skillful. </mark>
               As the drop was falling and you moved the canvas to try and make it land on a letter, the ink drop would not fall straight but curve. Making the drop turn in the air made it possible to hit the sides of a letter if you had the skill to control the movement of the canvas and the drop correctly. <br><br> However, after having a few people test our sketch, we felt that it was confusing for the player not having something in their hands to control the game with. <mark> We also thought that the unintended mechanic of curving the ink drop was a bit too hard for a game focused around learning definitions of letters, it didn’t quite fit in with the narrative or the main objective of the game.</mark> <br>To shoot the ink instead of a drop falling was our next prototyping step. We thought that moving a point on the canvas instead was a better and more satisfying implementation. </p>

              <h2>First digital prototype</h2>
              <p>The prototype consists of two different parts which work together:<br>
                - The digital prototype (the interface)<br>
                - and a physical controller.<br><br>
                The digital prototype is built in Unity  and shows a layer with different typefaces on it. The letters are separated in different parts (according to the different definitions). On the screen is a circle as the focus point, which can be moved by using a Nintendo controller. Our prototyped level in the game is in the historical context of the Bauhaus decade and shows therefore different typefaces like Xants Regular, Reross Quadratic and Alfarn Regular. Words which represent information about the Bauhaus decade are shown on the screen. In the background are a few colourful letters to represent the context and as graphical elements.<br><br>
                On the top of the screen is a black bar with the definitions in white letters inside it. After starting the game, the player should look for the right letter part that the current definition fits to. The focus point should be moved with the controller and when it is on top of a letter, the ink can be shot with the button on the controller. The player has a time limit of 1 minute and should shoot as many right parts as possible.
               <br><br> If the part was right, the ink would fill the part with an animation. If the part was wrong, the ink would splash and drop to the bottom. If the player miss the letter, it would also drop to the bottom. On the bottom, there is an “ink ocean”, which fills up with every missed drop of ink.

          <p> <mark>It was hard to have a sense of direction on the big canvas when using the small Nintendo controller.</mark> 
            So we decided to build a small box around the Nintendo controller. 
            The box can be held easily with two hands. In the middle of the box is a little hole, where a piece of cork is placed in order to press the button on the Nintendo controller inside.<br><br> 
            Personally I wasn’t a big fan of boxing in the Nintendo controller. 
            I felt that using a standard Playstation or Xbox controller would have given us better grip and provided the necessary sense of direction compared to the smaller Nintendo controller. 
            The box the controller was in felt a bit awkward to turn back and forth compared to a standard controller. 
            My opinion on this is a bit bias, because I’m more used to standard controllers when playing games. 
            However, spending time on creating a new controller in this particular scenario felt a bit unnecessary. 
            <mark>In my opinion building a new controller should come from better reasons, such as immersing the player in a different way than a standard controller can provide. 
                If that fits with the intended experience of the game.</mark></p>

          <h2>Playtesting</h2>
          <p>During the last weeks, we playtested with other students from other programs such as graphic design, engineering and product design. We discussed if we wanted to make a game for designers or an educational game for everyone. We figured out, that we need the easiest definitions with plenty of possible answers if the playtesters are not designers and don’t know anything about typefaces. That’s why we decided to use leg, cross stroke, bowl, shoulder and stem as definitions in the first level.
            To help participants which don’t know the words and answers, we wrote the solutions on the wide board next to the game. We thought about having a similar kind of cheat sheet on one side of the interface in the first level of the game later on. <br><br>

           Before the playtests we put together a few questions we wanted to ask the participants in the test session. In general, we wanted to know if the player understood the game (how to control it, the background, the goal). Also, we were interested in finding out if the game is fun for both design students and other students. Through the interviews and also the observation of the body language, we wanted to answer the questions. <br><br>
           Some of our important questions were: <br>
           - How did it feel to move the circle (frame) around?<br>
           - How did the movement feel like when shooting the ink?<br>
           - Did you understand what to do? What was unclear?<br>
           - Was it hard to learn?
            </p>

          <h2>Insights</h2>
          <p>All testers said that they need more feedback which time it is wrong and which the right part.  They missed a few game features such as score, lives, as well as typography descriptions. We learned that having the objective of the game close to the aim circle wasn’t a good idea, neither would having the letter become highlighted to show you where the target would be since it would counter the effect of learning and memorising the different characteristics. Instead, it is good to help with a ”hint” before the game begins or in the margin of the game canvas. <br><br>
            The movement feels dynamic – slow and fast movement feel precise.<br> Everyone keeps playing until we said they can stop if they want – which was a sign of them feeling the flow of the game.

          <h2>Final prototype</h2>
          <p>After the playtests, we knew that our main focus for further development should be on adding and changing feedback: The feedback for hitting and missing the letters was a bit unclear. Also the level design would contribute the game making it more connected to the background and words and make the user understand how it relates to the historical content in a better way, so we implemented these too for the final prototype.
